# LLM-API-TM

## Overview
`llm-api-tm` is an experimental project designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamically generating API calls from freeform text inputs. The initiative aims to bridge the gap between natural language processing and API interaction, making it more accessible for users without technical backgrounds in programming or API usage.

## Objectives
- To study the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for interpreting freeform text and translating it into structured API calls.
- To conduct a comparative analysis of multiple LLMs, assessing their performance in the context of API function calling.
- To develop standardized testing and evaluation criteria for comparing different LLMs.
- To investigate the impact of various prompt structures on the performance of LLMs in this specific application.

## Planned Approach
- **LLM Selection and Integration:** Identify and select a range of LLMs for experimentation, including OpenAI's models.
- **Function Calling Schema Development:** Plan to define function calling schemas that the LLMs can use to structure their responses, mimicking the process of API calls.
- **Comparative Analysis Methodology:** Outline the methodology for a comparative analysis of the selected LLMs.
- **Testing and Evaluation Framework:** Develop a framework for standardized testing and evaluation of LLMs.
- **Prompt Structure Experiments:** Design experiments to test the effectiveness of different prompt structures across various LLMs.

## Future Steps
- **Implementation:** Once the planning phase is complete, the project will move towards the implementation of the concepts outlined.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Provide detailed documentation and example use cases once the implementation begins.
- **Community Feedback:** Seek community feedback and contributions to refine and enhance the project.
